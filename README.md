# songs-wellbeing
The purpose of this analysis is to study the impact of the COVID-19 on well-being, by using song sentiment as a proxy. Even though many papers tackle the issue of COVID-19 on welfare, we wanted to use a new variable to measure it. Indeed, songs can be used as it can reflect how people feel. This approach can be useful for further studies.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound global impacts, with over 777 million confirmed cases and more than 7 million deaths worldwide, leading to widespread lockdowns and financial losses [3]. These restrictions have significantly influenced psychological well-being. This research seeks to examine the effects of COVID-19 on well-being through the lens of song sentiments, a globally comparable and language-free measure of emotional states [4]. The edge that music consumption has is that unlike search behaviors that may reflect information-seeking rather than emotions-it is a direct expression of sentiment. We use NLP to analyze song lyrics and extract sentiment, inferring individualsâ€™ moods from their music consumption during the pandemic.
